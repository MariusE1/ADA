Correcting Previous Mistakes from Imbalanced Datasets:

1. Never test on the oversampled or undersampled dataset.
2. If we want to implement cross validation, remember to oversample or undersample your training data during cross-validation, not before!
3. Don't use accuracy score as a metric with imbalanced datasets (will be usually high and misleading), instead use f1-score, precision/recall score or confusion matrix
